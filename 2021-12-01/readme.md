## Number of Paths

* Calculation continues to run, currently finished PM Peak, and part way through AM Peak
* The Calculation is memory intensive due to the number of paths. Some OD pairs result in upwards of 150GB of memory (physical and virtual), and up to 10 million non-unique paths
* Modifications to the code was done due to memory issues, I anticipate the remaining calculations will be faster
